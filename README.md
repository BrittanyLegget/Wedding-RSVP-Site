## About The Project

This project was for a Bride and Groom that wanted their guests to be able to RSVP to their wedding events through a website.

There were a total of 5 events for their wedding but not everyone was invited to all 5, so the couple only wanted the guests to see the events they were invited to (nobody should feel left out!). The guests were given a code on their wedding invite that was good for their entire family, so the RSVP page needed to allow for a seperate RSVP for each member of the family for each event they were invited to.

It was also important for the web app to be mobile responsive since the demographic ranges from old to young so guests could be using any size device. I was happy to oblige since everything these days should be mobile responsive!

The Groom really wanted a modern MySpace style layout so the images below are what they asked for (yes, they gave me a figma mock-up, can't we all be so lucky!)


## Check Out The Demo
