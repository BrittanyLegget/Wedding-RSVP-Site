            We met at Sunset Lanes in Beaverton, OR at a mutual friendâ€™s going
            away party in early 2015. We started dating a year later and soon
            moved to Klamath Falls to finish school at Oregon Institute of
            Technology. In 2019 we both graduated with degrees in Health
            Informatics and Civil Engineering. A year and a half ago we bought a
            house in Klamath Falls and have built a home together with our two
            cats; Boots and Diamond. Dani works from home as the Business
            Intelligence Manager for a healthcare organization and Jon is a
            Civil Engineer for a consultng firm in Klamath Falls. We got engaged
